To anyone having issues downloading PROJECT SKYRIM wabbajack latest install or anyone who simply doesn't know how to do it, don't worry, it's quite easy to do so, first you'll need:

-an original steam copy of skyrim special edition (it doesn't matter where you installed it, as long as it is in your PC)

-at least 270 GB of free SSD space (yeah a lot, I know, but it is worth it)
-at least 180 GB of free HDD space for the downloads

-a nexus account (premium recommended, although optional)
-a loverslab account
-a vector plexus account (vector plexus is also known as vector plexis, the site changed it's domain)

these are MY specs:

Ryzen 5 5600X
16GB DDR4 3000Mhz
NVIDIA GTX 1650
SSD NVME 480GB
a budget motherboard
a non-gsync monitor (it's old as fuck I'm sorry)

The only spec that I'll recommend having better than mine is a graphics card, anything from a GTX 1080/RTX 3050 to a RTX 3090 will be able to run this way better, I am pretty sure that RTX 3070TI will run this at 60 FPS  on exteriors without too much drop (if any) on heavy areas.

### WARNING: Before you start downloading Project Skyrim via Wabbajack, TURN OFF your antivirus to avoid any problems during mod list installation. You can turn on your antivirus have you are done with Wabbajack. 

1 - Start with a fresh install of Skyrim Special Edition or Anniversary Edition, ideally from Steam. (If you already have a modded Skyrim profile in MO2, you will be fine. Project Skyrim will install a new MO2 for you.)
    Installing on an SSD is recommended but an HDD will work as well.

2 - Download Project Skyrim and the INI files here: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/76466/?tab=description

3 - Create three new folders in your drive; "Project Skyrim" | "Wabbajack" | "Wabbajack Downloads" like so:

Copy the files inside to your "Wabbajack" folder.

Also copy the Wabbajack files to your folder "Wabbajack", it should include Wabbajack.exe and wabbajack-cli.bat


# Inside The Game

1 - After hitting on a new game and passing through the RaceMenu tab, the mods will start to load and configure itself, don't worry, this process is automatic and won't take long

2 - I recommend waiting a little until a pink bar appears on your hud, then press "-" on your numerical keys (the right part of the keyboard) and then press 9 on your standard keys (the middle part of the keyboard). This will make both the bar disappear and disable the poser framework for screenshots 

3 - After that, I recommend cleaning the clutter on your inventory, simply read the enslaved wenches, use the additem menu to receive the additem menus and get rid of everything else

4 - Then, choose your alternate start by exploring the realm,  after spawning in its location, open the esc menu, and then go to the MCM tab, look for "MCM Recorder", click it and find "After alternate start", click that to begin the second procedure, close all menus and you'll be prompted with a text, click on "run recording", and wait for a while

5 - Then, open the MCM menu again, look for "Wet Function Redux SE", click on that, click on the Targets menu, on the top right click on the selection of your character, and then hit "START EFFECT", close all menus

6 - Finally, open the MCM menu, look for "Shadow of Skyrim" click on General and hit Enable, press ok and wait, if it shows that Shadow of Skyrim failed to initiliaze, do this last  whole process again. 
Known game issues: 

Shadow of Skyrim refuses to start sometimes, but can be fixed by trying again
There is a floating dagger on riverwood that should be attached to a tree that got removed due to Nature of The Wild Lands mod, I'll fix it in a later update by adding an ESL patch to it
