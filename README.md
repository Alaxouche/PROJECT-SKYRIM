To anyone having issues downloading PROJECT SKYRIM wabbajack latest install or anyone who simply doesn't know how to do it, don't worry, it's quite easy to do so, first you'll need:

-an original steam copy of skyrim special edition (it doesn't matter where you installed it, as long as it is in your PC)

-at least 270 GB of free SSD space (yeah a lot, I know, but it is worth it)
-at least 180 GB of free HDD space for the downloads

-a nexus account (premium recommended, although optional)
-a loverslab account
-a vector plexus account (vector plexus is also known as vector plexis, the site changed it's domain)

these are MY specs:

Ryzen 5 5600X
16GB DDR4 3000Mhz
NVIDIA GTX 1650
SSD NVME 480GB
a budget motherboard
a non-gsync monitor (it's old as fuck I'm sorry)

The only spec that I'll recommend having better than mine is a graphics card, anything from a GTX 1080/RTX 3050 to a RTX 3090 will be able to run this way better, I am pretty sure that RTX 3070TI will run this at 60 FPS  on exteriors without too much drop (if any) on heavy areas. 
Installation steps

# How To Install

1 -  Download Wabbajack.exe from it's website and put it in C:\Wabbajack (recommended)

2 - Download my Project Skyrim.rar to a folder on C:\Project Skyrim Files (preferably the latest version unless told to avoid it)

3 - Extract my Project Skyrim.rar

4 - Run Wabbajack and click on the gear icon on the top right and look to the left panel to log in into your accounts

5 - Click on Install from Disk and choose the wabbajack file that you've extracted from Project Skyrim.rar

6 - On installation location, choose a new folder on your C:, i.e: C:\Project Skyrim

7 - On downloads location, choose a new folder to download the mods and files, this folder can be deleted later to save space, however, I do recommend you to choose a folder that is on another drive, and yes, it can be a HDD because this is only for providing sources to the installation

8 - Click on the "play" button and wait

9 - There will be a few "manual" downloads, wabbajack will prompt you to click to download a certain mod, there are around 14 mods that need this process, however there are two mods specifically which need you to scroll down to find certain attachments, don't worry they aren't hard to find, but in the prompt there will be a "please hit CTRL F", I didn't knew it but CTRL F doesn't work on the Wabbajack in-built browser, so just scroll down, I'm sorry.

10 - After the prompts for the manual downloads are over, just wait, the average install  time is around 6+ hours, it really depends on your internet connection and your hardware

Known installer issues: sometimes mods that are off nexus might get broken on the installation, this happened on older versions, I am unsure if it will happen in this recent versions, if there are any issues as extraction errors, don't worry, you'll simply need to download the file manually and replace it in the Wabbajack downloads folder that you've set so it can continue the procedure, feel free to say something in the help-and-support channel that I'll be there to guide you through this process, note that this only happens with non-nexus downloads, so if it happens it will be 15 files at max.
NOTE: the ENB files have been optimized for max performance, I'll upload different presets in a few hours to suit everyone's tastes and hardwares (as well as inis for the game itself, the default inis are bethini medium preset with some custom optimizations)
Inside the game procedure:

# Inside The Game

1 - After hitting on a new game and passing through the RaceMenu tab, the mods will start to load and configure itself, don't worry, this process is automatic and won't take long

2 - I recommend waiting a little until a pink bar appears on your hud, then press "-" on your numerical keys (the right part of the keyboard) and then press 9 on your standard keys (the middle part of the keyboard). This will make both the bar disappear and disable the poser framework for screenshots 

3 - After that, I recommend cleaning the clutter on your inventory, simply read the enslaved wenches, use the additem menu to receive the additem menus and get rid of everything else

4 - Then, choose your alternate start by exploring the realm,  after spawning in its location, open the esc menu, and then go to the MCM tab, look for "MCM Recorder", click it and find "After alternate start", click that to begin the second procedure, close all menus and you'll be prompted with a text, click on "run recording", and wait for a while

5 - Then, open the MCM menu again, look for "Wet Function Redux SE", click on that, click on the Targets menu, on the top right click on the selection of your character, and then hit "START EFFECT", close all menus

6 - Finally, open the MCM menu, look for "Shadow of Skyrim" click on General and hit Enable, press ok and wait, if it shows that Shadow of Skyrim failed to initiliaze, do this last  whole process again. 
Known game issues: 

Shadow of Skyrim refuses to start sometimes, but can be fixed by trying again
There is a floating dagger on riverwood that should be attached to a tree that got removed due to Nature of The Wild Lands mod, I'll fix it in a later update by adding an ESL patch to it
