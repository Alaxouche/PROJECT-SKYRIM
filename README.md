# Preamble

**PROJECT SKYRIM** is a modlist that is content and gameplay oriented, ***focusing on expansions, overhauls, and healthy adjustments to the systems and features that exist in Skyrim***, while expanding to become the most diverse. It focuses on gameplay, world space add-ons, quests, etc. 

**PROJECT SKYRIM** also comes with an adult content addon, that is completely unintrusive.

**`Which means that nothing will appear on your face without you wishing for it to happen, you can completely ignore.`**




# System Requirements

With the performance mode options being available, exact minimum requirements is hard to nail down, you may need to change INI files with lower systems.


### **Minimum Specs**
| CPU        | GPU   |  RAM  | Performance|
| ------------- |:-------------:| :-----:| :-----:|
| Ryzen 5 3600      | Nvidia GTX 1080 | 16GB RAM DDR4 | 40 FPS |




### **Recommended Specs**
| CPU        | GPU   |  RAM  | Performance|
| ------------- |:-------------:| :-----:| :-----:|
| Ryzen 5 5600x      | RTX 3070 TI | 16GB RAM DDR4 | 60 FPS |

**You also need**
- 290GB for Install 
- 190GB for Download

**Notes**
- There is very low difference between High and High Optimized in terms of visuals, but you can get more FPS. 
- All inis will change and vary depending on the specific area you are on game due to SKSE Plugins that will cover it for more FPS
- The recommended INI file is High Optimized
- You can change the INI files, specially the resolution, either to cover higher resolutions such as 1440p or to reduce it so that NIS will increase it's performance
- It's not recommended to play this modlist at 4K due to the lack of mod support to the widescreen fix.


# Installation
This is a precise and easy-to-install tutorial about the mod list Project Skyrim. We aim to streamline the process and help you to remove any doubts about the installation.
## Pre-Installation
### Installing Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package

I doubt you need to do this since you likely already have this installed. The package is required for MO2, and you can download it from **[Microsoft](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads)**. Download the x64 version under "Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019". **[Direct link](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)** if you can't find it.
### Installing Microsoft .NET 5.0

Please ensure you have .NET v5.0 installed (**EVEN IF YOU HAVE .NET 6.0 INSTALLED**). The game will not launch if you do not have it installed. Download the **desktop app x64 AND console app x64 installers** from Microsoft [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0/runtime).


<a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0/runtime"><img alt="Microsoft" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27007797/198383090-15ce8391-fbc0-49a9-acb8-94b36ce3a811.png" width="555" height="294"></a>




### Websites & Programs
- [Loverslab Account](https://www.loverslab.com/)
- [Vector plexus Account](https://vectorplexis.com/)
- [Nexus Account (Premium recommended)](https://www.nexusmods.com/)

### <sub>**Loverslab requires a VPN for some users, some countries cannot access Loverslab (Japan, Thailand etc.)**</sub>

### Clean Skyrim
Start with a fresh install of [Skyrim Special Edition or Anniversary Edition](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition). You should also clean up the Skyrim Special Edition folder in Documents/My Games/ by deleting its contents. Installing on an SSD is recommended but an HDD will work as well.

Copy the files inside to your "Wabbajack" folder.

Also copy the Wabbajack files to your folder "Wabbajack", it should include Wabbajack.exe and wabbajack-cli.bat

********VIDEO***********

in the video, the folder "project" should be "Project Skyrim" or however you named your installation folder.

4 - Once you have completed Step 3, open Wabbajack.exe in your "Wabbajack" folder. 

a. Click the cog/settings button at the top right, and login to your three accounts on Lovers Lab, Nexus Mods, and Vector Plexus. Do NOT skip this mini-step.

b. Click "Install From Disk" and go to your "Wabbajack" folder, select the "Project Skyrim.wabbajack" file.

   Set your paths like so:

5 - Some mods will have to be downloaded manually. It will pop up a window with the site to download the mod from. At the top, it will tell you which file exactly to download.

If you have downloaded the wrong one it will let you know at the end. Don't panic. 

If there is an error or it closes, you won't need to re-download mods you have already downloaded.

********VIDEO***********

6 - When Wabbajack is done downloading the Project Skyrim modlist, there will be some missing mods, giving you an error. 
Go to ðŸ“šï¸±important-links on discord aand download the mods you are missing or have issues with.

Wabbajack will also let you know which mods have issues in the log at the bottom left.

There are two mo2-plugins that will have to be downloaded manually:
The first is downloaded from: https://github.com/LostDragonist/MO2-Plugins/archive/refs/heads/master.zip

The second one is downloaded at: https://github.com/deorder/mo2-plugins/archive/refs/heads/master.zip
    You will have to rename this file to "mo2-plugins-master deorder"
Any files you have manually downloaded will have to go into the "Wabbajack Downloads" folder.

If you do get an error for Skyrim 2k, here is the link:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qj6LQR-bsNkUG8LJ0UPT8Yzbih2fW6b7/view?usp=sharing

7 - Once you have finished installing the modlist without errors, you can open your "Project Skyrim" folder, and create a shortcut for Mod Organizer.

8 - You are now on the final steps!

    Open your folders like so, "Project Skyrim ((Version))" -> "profiles" -> "Project Skyrim" 
    The directory address should look like in the image below:

![unknown (4)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116535023/197654286-85c3f5f4-63e3-4ede-adb3-080ce06e48c1.png)

Open the INI files .RAR file you downloaded, and copy the files inside it into the folder.

9 -  You can now launch Project Skyrim from Mod Organizer by clicking the "Run" button at the top right. Make sure you have "SKSE" selected. The first boot might take a while to get going, so be patient.

If your downloads tab in MO2 looks like this, do not be alarmed.

Wabbajack does not download meta files (these files give you info about what you did to the mod). MO2 generates default meta files for each mod and looks at it. But yes, everything is fine.
