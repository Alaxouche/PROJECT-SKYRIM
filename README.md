To anyone having issues downloading PROJECT SKYRIM wabbajack latest install or anyone who simply doesn't know how to do it, don't worry, it's quite easy to do so, first you'll need:

-an original steam copy of skyrim special edition (it doesn't matter where you installed it, as long as it is in your PC)

-at least 270 GB of free SSD space (yeah a lot, I know, but it is worth it)
-at least 180 GB of free HDD space for the downloads

-a nexus account (premium recommended, although optional)
-a loverslab account
-a vector plexus account (vector plexus is also known as vector plexis, the site changed it's domain)

these are MY specs:

Ryzen 5 5600X
16GB DDR4 3000Mhz
NVIDIA GTX 1650
SSD NVME 480GB
a budget motherboard
a non-gsync monitor (it's old as fuck I'm sorry)

The only spec that I'll recommend having better than mine is a graphics card, anything from a GTX 1080/RTX 3050 to a RTX 3090 will be able to run this way better, I am pretty sure that RTX 3070TI will run this at 60 FPS  on exteriors without too much drop (if any) on heavy areas.

6 - When Wabbajack is done downloading the Project Skyrim modlist, there will be some missing mods, giving you an error. 
Go to ðŸ“šï¸±important-links on discord aand download the mods you are missing or have issues with.

Wabbajack will also let you know which mods have issues in the log at the bottom left.

There are two mo2-plugins that will have to be downloaded manually:
The first is downloaded from: https://github.com/LostDragonist/MO2-Plugins/archive/refs/heads/master.zip

The second one is downloaded at: https://github.com/deorder/mo2-plugins/archive/refs/heads/master.zip
    You will have to rename this file to "mo2-plugins-master deorder"
Any files you have manually downloaded will have to go into the "Wabbajack Downloads" folder.

If you do get an error for Skyrim 2k, here is the link:

7 - Once you have finished installing the modlist without errors, you can open your "Project Skyrim" folder, and create a shortcut for Mod Organizer.

8 - You are now on the final steps!

    Open your folders like so, "Project Skyrim ((Version))" -> "profiles" -> "Project Skyrim" 
    The directory address should look like in the image below:

![unknown (4)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116535023/197654286-85c3f5f4-63e3-4ede-adb3-080ce06e48c1.png)

Open the INI files .RAR file you downloaded, and copy the files inside it into the folder.

9 -  You can now launch Project Skyrim from Mod Organizer by clicking the "Run" button at the top right. Make sure you have "SKSE" selected. The first boot might take a while to get going, so be patient.

If your downloads tab in MO2 looks like this, do not be alarmed.

Wabbajack does not download meta files (these files give you info about what you did to the mod). MO2 generates default meta files for each mod and looks at it. But yes, everything is fine.
